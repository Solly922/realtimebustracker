# Real Time Bus Tracker

<p>The planned funtionality is to have a real time bus tracker. Currently, the marker will only move on the bus stops. You have to open the developer console and type "move()" for that to work. This is not as polished as I want it to be, but there will hopefully be future updates.</p>
